            This website is dedicated to established and inspiring homebrewers who have limited space, but unlimited dreams! Here you will find guides to get you started with homebrewing, 
            information on grains to start an ale all the way to a Russian Impreial Stout, types of yeast and which beer styles as well as a claculator to convert the Specific Gravity reading
            from your refractometer to Brix to determine you orginal gravity (OG) and your final gravity (FG).

            About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            My name is Rachel and I have been homebrewing for a few years now.  While I do not consider myself an expert, the purpose of creating this website is to insipire other small-home dwellers
            to begin the journey of homebrewing. <br /> My homebrewing journey begain shortly after purchasing a one-gallon homebrewing kit for my husband for Christmas.  We had recently seen a demonstration at a
            local brewery and I was facinated by how easy it looked.  After we brewed our first beer together I was hooked!  I got my very own carboy and supplies and immediately started writing recipies.  The possibilities were endless!
            My first beer was a play on the Samyang Fire Noodles (cream ale with a dash of the nuclear fire noodle sauce).  Was it great? Not really. Was it exciting? Absolutely!  If you are new to the homebrewing world, know that you will make mistakes.
            You will make bad beer, we all have. We also have all made great beer and isn't the world and every small corner in it a better place with great beer?  Yes, yes it is.
